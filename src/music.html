        <p>
          Music Ministry at College Lutheran involves all members of the congregation as they participate in the hymns, songs, psalms, acclamations, and musical responses of the liturgy. There are also members who sing in the choir, play an
          instrument, provide special music at times, or supply names of others within the community to contact as guest musicians. We sing and play to the glory of God.

          Currently, the Adult Choir sings from September through Pentecost Sunday. We warm up and prepare on Sunday mornings before worship and practice for about an hour after worship for the upcoming Sundays and festivals. The choir generally has
          one Sunday off a month, which is when guest musicians are invited to join us. Instrumentalists such as guitar, winds, brass, strings, often accompany the choir anthem as well. And we especially try to highlight and include our youth
          musicians from CLC and from the community. We are always looking to include new instrumentalists, and we also invite any vocalists to join us in the choir.

          During this 500th anniversary year of the Reformation, we have been including a Luther or German chorale within the liturgy, often as the offertory or post-communion canticle. These may or may not be familiar hymns but a way to weekly
          recall the Reformation, Martin Luther, and many others who have been part of the ongoing reformation and mission of Christâ€™s people and his Church.

          Last year we learned most of Holy Communion Setting One from the ELW and will learn the remaining portion this fall. We also use Settings One and Two from the LBW and Setting Five from With One Voice. We generally sing the psalm using a
          variety of musical options but do speak it during the summer and for certain occasions such as Ash Wednesday.

          College Lutheran Church is home to 5 octaves of handbells. But we need many hands to make a bell choir possible again so please consider this music ministry option. It is helpful if you read music but not necessary; if you enjoy music and
          can count, this could be a wonderful new experience and would bring the bells back to re-sounding joy in our church, to the delight of everyone here.

          The Sunday School children provide a song for us during worship periodically and present the annual Advent/Christmas program in December. Music ministry participates in other congregational programs such as Trunk or Treat, carol and hymn
          sings, a sing-along at the parish picnic, etc.

          A Hymn Committee works with the Director of Music in the selection of the hymns for all Sundays of the year. Most of our hymns come from either the LBW (Lutheran Book of Worship, 1988) or WOV (With One Voice, 1995) which are both in the
          pews, or from the ELW (Evangelical Lutheran Worship hymnal, 2006) which we do not have but from which we can download hymns for our weekly bulletins.
