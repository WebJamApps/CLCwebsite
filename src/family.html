            Children are indispensable at College Lutheran Church. The Children and Family Ministry at College Lutheran Church supports kids in preschool through 5th grade and their families. Age appropriate Sunday School, monthly meet-ups, and
            seasonal events such as Trunk or Treating, Christmas Programs, Easter Parties, and Vacation Bible School are a few of the ways that we familiarize our children with Biblical stories and the power of living in Christian community.

          <p>Children are also encouraged to be full participants in worship. They may follow along in the bulletin with a parent or use the children’s activity bags located outside the doors at the back of the sanctuary. Both the children’s
            sermon
            and the kid’s food offering are special parts of the service designated for kid participation. Additionally, there is a Nursery available during worship (located on the 2nd floor), if parents prefer to have their children enjoy a safe
            play zone.
